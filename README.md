Unemployment Rate vs GDP Per Capita



High unemployment rates are currently a crisis, especially for fresh graduates in Kenya, because it limits their ability to find employment and start their careers, leading to financial insecurity and hindering their future prospects. It also contributes to a wider societal issue of underemployment, poverty, and inequality.
This presentation will explore the relationship between unemployment rates and GDP per capita in 80 countries worldwide, including Africa, America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, from 2010 to 2021.
The dataset used in this study contains information on unemployment rates and GDP per capita for each country over the specified period. Through statistical analysis, this presentation will investigate whether there is a significant correlation between unemployment rates and GDP per capita and whether this relationship varies across different continents and periods.
The findings of this study will provide insight into the complex factors that influence employment and economic growth on a global, continent, and country scale and may have implications for policymakers seeking to address unemployment and economic inequality.
